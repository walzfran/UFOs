# UFOs

### Overview of the Analysis 
##### For this challenge we were tasked with assisting Dana, a data journalist, create a website to display UFO sightings data. Because there are so many sightings, we want to filter the data to just display what the user is looking for. We were given a data set that contained information that was broken down into 7 categories including date, city, state, country, UFO shape, duration and comments on the UFO. With all of these different ways to categorize the date, we need a simple way for users to search for exactly what they are looking for. A couple of the categories would not make sense for filters - duration and comment, while this information is very useful for the user it would be pretty difficult to pin point searches based around information with so many variables. In the module we worked on creating one filter and a button to implement the search but we wanted to be able to filter the data with multiple filters. 

### Results 
##### I was able to meet all criteria for the challenge, below is an image that displays what the website looks like before any data is filtered.

##### As you can see there is a few different filters that can be used individually or compiled to search. To display the filtered data that you are looking for simply type a date, city, state, country or shape of the UFO. For this example we will filter by counrty and shape, I have chosen to use Canada and a disk shape. Simply type "ca" in for country and "disk" for shape, press enter and this is the result you will get.

### Summary 
##### Although this is a functioning website that we created for Dana, one drawback is that the filters do not clear after a search is performed. This means that each time you would like to run a new search you have to manually clear the fields that were initially searched. While this is not a huge inconvenience it is a step that if not taken could alter the filtered data for the user if they are not careful to clear the fields they are no longer looking to filter by. 

##### If I were to make two recommendations for further development, the first would be to address the drawback that I just mentioned. For this you would have to write code to clear the fields after each filter. For this I can imagine there are a few soultions for this, one that I can think of would be to have a button put back in, and then one the button is clicked it would clear the fields before the user was able to re-filter the data and perform a new search. 

##### A second recommendation I have would to be working on the formatting a bit, I do like the color scheme that we picked for this and the image is nice as well but I think the middle section including the quote looks a bit unfinished. I would take it out of table format it is in and make it more of a list that might be centered. The home link button we created at the top also does not appear to be a working text link which may lead users of the site to not utilize it, I would format to be more of a bolded font and potentially a different color and add an image that may lead users to think it is a "clickable" word. Or, if there were other pages that Dana wanted to display, you could format those to be in a smaller font in a horizontal line to lead to more of a contents bar.
