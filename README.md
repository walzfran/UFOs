# UFOs

### Overview of the Analysis 
##### For this challenge we were tasked with assisting Dana, a data journalist, create a website to display UFO sightings data. Because there are so many sightings, we want to filter the data to just display what the user is looking for. We were given a data set that contained information that was broken down into 7 categories including date, city, state, country, UFO shape, duration and comments on the UFO. With all of these different ways to categorize the date, we need a simple way for users to search for exactly what they are looking for. A couple of the categories would not make sense for filters - duration and comment, while this information is very useful for the user it would be pretty difficult to pin point searches based around information with so many variables. In the module we worked on creating one filter and a button to implement the search but we wanted to be able to filter the data with multiple filters.
